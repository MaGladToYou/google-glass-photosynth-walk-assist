# google-glass-photosynth-walk-assist
This project is created to present an application that assists in creating photosynth walks on photosynth.net/preview using google glass.

It was motivated after attempting to take photos with glass and finding it annoying to have to continually press the camera button while walking.

This is a very raw state and will likely crash.

Heavily dependant on cuXtomCamLibrary.
